# Web Interface MoSCoW Analysis

MoSCoW is based on four levels of priority. These are:

- Must Have
    - This is a required feature and must be implemented.
- Should have
    - These features provide very beneficial additions to the application, but are not essential to its functionality.
      They are implemented once all higher priority have been completed.
- Could have
    - These may provide a positive benefit to the product, but are not essential. They are implemented as time permits
      and according to user feedback during release cycles.
- Won't Have
    - These are deemed not feasible, too high price, or not connected to the product's original target audience
